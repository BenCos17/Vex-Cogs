# Vex-Cogs

These are a few cogs I made for myself that may be useful to others. Mostly utility-based.
These are for Red V3, an open source Discord bot. See their repo [here](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/).

## Getting my cogs

`[p]` is your prefix.

Add the repo: `[p]repo add vex https://github.com/Vexed01/Vex-Cogs`

Then you can install cogs: `[p]cog install vex cogname`

There's a list of cogs below you can use `[p]cog list vex`

| Cog name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `aliases` | Get all the information you could ever need about a command's aliases. |
| `anotherpingcog` | Just another ping cog... But this one has fancy colours in an embed! |
| `status` | Recieve automatic status updates from various services, including Discord. |

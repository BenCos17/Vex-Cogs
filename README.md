# Vex-Cogs

These are a few cogs I made for myself that may be useful to others. Mostly utility-based.
These are for [Red V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/), an open source self-hosted Discord bot. If this is your first time with Red,
take a look at the [docs](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/).

## Getting my cogs

`[p]` is your prefix.

Add the repo: `[p]repo add vex-cogs https://github.com/Vexed01/Vex-Cogs`

Then you can install cogs: `[p]cog install vex-cogs cogname`

There's a list of cogs below you can use `[p]cog list vex-cogs`

| Cog name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [aliases](https://vex-cogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/aliases.html) | Get all the information you could ever need about a command's aliases. |
| [anotherpingcog](https://vex-cogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/anotherpingcog.html) | Just another ping cog... But this one has fancy colours in an embed! |
| [github](https://vex-cogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github.html) | Create, comment, labelify and close GitHub issues, with partial PR support. |
| [status](https://vex-cogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html) | Recieve automatic status updates from various services, including Discord. |
| [system](https://vex-cogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system.html) | Get system metrics of the host device, such as RAM or CPU. |

All these cogs have docs! Check them out at <https://vex-cogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest> or click on the cog name to go directly to that cog's docs page.

# Vex-Cogs

These are a few cogs I made for myself that may be useful to others. Mostly utility-based.
These are for Red V3, an open source Discord bot. See their repo [here](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/).

PRs are welcome! This repo is formatted with Black, line length 120. Don't worry, I'll still merge your PR regardless of whether you've reformatted.

I can be found in the [main Red server](https://discord.gg/red) or the [Cog Support server](https://discord.gg/GET4DVk). I'm Vexed#3211 on Discord.

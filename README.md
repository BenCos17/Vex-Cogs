# Vex-Cogs

These are a few cogs I made for myself that may be useful to others. Mostly utility-based.
These are for [Red V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/), an open source self-hosted Discord bot. If this is your first time with Red,
take a look at the [docs](https://docs.discord.red).

## Getting my cogs

`[p]` is your prefix.

Add the repo: `[p]repo add vex-cogs https://github.com/Vexed01/Vex-Cogs`

Then you can install cogs: `[p]cog install vex-cogs cogname`

There's a list of cogs below you can use `[p]cog list vex-cogs`

| Cog name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [aliases](https://vex-cogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cogs/aliases.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cog_table) | Get all the information you could ever need about a command's aliases. |

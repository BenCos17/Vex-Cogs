Getting my cogs
===============

``[p]`` is your prefix.

.. note::
    You can replace ``vex`` with whatever you want, but you'll need to type it
    out every time you install one of my cogs so make sure it's simple. Note
    it's case sensitive.

1. First, you need to add the my repository (repo):
    .. code-block:: none

        [p]repo add vex-cogs https://github.com/Vexed01/Vex-Cogs

2. Now you can install my cogs with this command:
    .. code-block:: none

        [p]cog install vex-cogs cogname


You can list my cogs with this command:

.. code-block:: none

    [p]cog list vex-cogs

.. tip::

    It's a good idea to keep cogs up to date. You should run this command
    every now and again to update all your cogs:

    .. code-block:: none

        [p]cog update

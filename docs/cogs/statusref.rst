Below you will see previews for different modes, and webhook.


Modes
=====

The below modes were sent *without* a webhook.

------------
All and Edit

.. note::

    The edit mode is the same as the all mode, however it will only send one message per
    per incident. This message will then be edited to reflect recent updates.

Webhook
=======

To stay brief only the ``latest`` mode is included, however the ``all`` and ``edit`` modes
are also fully supported - just with a few more fields in the embed.

It is storage efficient, using under 150 bytes per day.\n\n**Please carefully read the information bellow about some of the cog's inner workings.**\n\nWhen you first load the cog, the `uptime` command will say **data may be inaccurate** for first **15** minutes. Once the cog's been running for a while, data over 30 days old will no longer be counted in the `uptime` command.\n\nPlease avoid excessively reloading the cog. This cog tries to handle unloads/reloads but you might experience limited data loss.\n\nThis cog has docs! Check them out at <https://go.vexcodes.com/c/betteruptime>",

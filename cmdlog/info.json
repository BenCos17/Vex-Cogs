They are logged with the logging `logging` module, so they'll appear in the bot's console or main logs (search for `red.vexed.cmdlog`) and an internal cache is kept which you can see in Discord with the `cmdlog` command.\n\nThis cog has docs!

    "end_user_data_statement": "This cog does not intend to persistently store data or metadata about users.\n\nThe following End User Data (EUD) is temporarily stored in memory for all commands executed and check failures:\n1. Command invoked (not including arguments/original message)\n2. User that invoked the command - User ID, Username, and discriminator at the time of the command invoke\nIf the command was executed in a server, the following information is also temporarily stored:\n3. Channel the command was invoked in - Channel ID and name as of the time of command invoke\n4. Server the command was invoked in - Server ID and name as of the time of command invoke\n\nThis data is also logged to the console using Python's logging module. This means it is stored in the bot's log files. Red rotates these log files, while means old log files and the corresponding End User Data are deleted once the logs fill up. This means EUD is stored in log files for an unspecified period.\n\nNo data is collected if you do not interact with me via my prefix.\n\nThis cog is quite memory efficient, it limits to holding 20k commands which is around 1MB of RAM.\n\nThis cog does not comply with data deletion requests as the internal cache is not persistent and it is not feasible or safe to remove data from log files."

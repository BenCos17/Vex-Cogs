This is my top priority.\nI'll be adding more services in the next few days.\nI will also shortly be adding a preview, which will not fetch a new update but use the last one that was stored.\nThis currently needs embed permissions. A non embed version will be coming soon.\n(today is the 17th Feb)\n\nFor feedback or requests, it's Vexed#3211 on Discord or on the GH repo. This is a new cog, I would certainly appreciate suggestions",

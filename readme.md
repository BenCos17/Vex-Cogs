# ``gh-pages`` branch

This hosts icons for my status cog.

This branch is intended to host data for getting whether the cog's version is up to date for the `[p]<cogname>info` command.

It is automatically updated using the `autoapi.py` file and GH Actions on the main branch.

I know it's in a folder called API which really isn't corrent but oh well, bit late to change it now for past compatibility reasons.

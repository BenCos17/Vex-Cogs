Info about available platforms is in the help menu.\n\nThis cog supports **both embeds and non-embeds**. Embeds are enabled by default, you can disable them with **`[p]system toggleembed`**. If embeds are set to be off with the core command `embedset`, that will override the setting for this cog.\nThis DOES NOT try to be similar to standard console commands.\n\nThis cog has docs!
